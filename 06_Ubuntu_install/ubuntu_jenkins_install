https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+on+Ubuntu
============================================================
On Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu, you can install Jenkins through apt-get.

Recent versions are available in an apt repository. Older but stable LTS versions are in this apt repository.

You need to have a JDK and JRE installed. openjdk-7-jre and openjdk-7-jdk are suggested. As of 2011-08 gcj is known to be problematic - see sudo apt-get updatehttps://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-743.

Please make sure to back up any current Hudson or Jenkins files you may have.

Installation

wget -q -O - https://jenkins-ci.org/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins

Upgrade

Once installed like this, you can update to the later version of Jenkins (when it comes out) by running the following commands:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins

(aptitude or apt-get doesn't make any difference.)

What does this package do?

    Jenkins will be launched as a daemon up on start. See /etc/init.d/jenkins for more details.
    The 'jenkins' user is created to run this service.
    Log file will be placed in /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log. Check this file if you are troubleshooting Jenkins.
    /etc/default/jenkins will capture configuration parameters for the launch like e.g JENKINS_HOME
    By default, Jenkins listen on port 8080. Access this port with your browser to start configuration.

If your /etc/init.d/jenkins file fails to start jenkins, edit the /etc/default/jenkins to replace the line

HTTP_PORT=8080

by

HTTP_PORT=8081

Here, 8081 was chosen but you can put another port available.
