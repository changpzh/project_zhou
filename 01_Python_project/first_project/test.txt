The new data center will enhance our computing capability in developing and sharing global innovations by advanced EE Cloud and Telco cloud solutions. With this new data center, the cloud-based platform will enable Nokia to speed up to-the-market and better satisfy the customers, which will help Nokia better support the China market.


The new data center is planned to start the operation in June 2016, and will satisfy the needs for future R&D and business development of Nokia in China. It will also serve as another proof point of Nokia??s long term commitment to China.  Nokia has been deeply engaged with China since entering the market 33 years ago. We develop innovations in China, for China, and for the world. As one of the three global Technology Centers(TC) located in China, Hangzhou TC has grown to more than 3000 R&D engineers from around 30 employees when it was built in 2002.
