##Callbacks and Functions
Unlike many other programming languages, JavaScript enables you to freely pass functions around to be executed at a later time. A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after its parent function has completed. Callbacks are special because they patiently wait to execute until their parent finishes. Meanwhile, the browser can be executing other functions or doing all sorts of other work.

To use callbacks, it is important to know how to pass them into their parent function.
